## Configure your environment

1. [Install Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which will also install NPM (you should be able to execute `node --version` and `npm --version` on the command line).

2. Clone your repository by running `git clone REPO_URL` on the command line. You get the `REPO_URL` by clicking on the green button on the GitHub repository page.

3. Place the `config.env` file in the project root directory. Do NOT ever share this file with anyone.

## Project commands

Once your environment is configured you need to further prepare the project's tooling and dependencies. In the project directory:

1. `npm install` to download the project's dependencies.

2. `npm run dev` to start the server in development mode.
